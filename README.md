# Multi-modal autonomous beamline experimentation
SSRL Materials Sciences Division

The goal of this proposal is to create an infrastructure for autonomous beamline experiments utilizing multi-modal approaches at SSRL. This multi-modal approach can be incredibly general, whether it be machine learning assisted data acquisition, multi-resolution capable setups, or backend analysis-driven automation. In a recent proof-of-concept experiment at beamline 2-1 (Figure 1) we utilized a 2-detector setup and clever Python scripting to automate high-quality data acquisition.  Automated analysis of the fast, low-resolution data was used to autonomously collect slower, high-resolution data only in the information-rich regions around diffraction peaks.
